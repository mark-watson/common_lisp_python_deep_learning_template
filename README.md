# Mark Watson's personal Common Lisp + py4cl + pre-trained deep learning models template

This repo serves two purposes:

- It will eventually be an example in a new edition of my Common Lisp book (see [https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson](https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson))
- I will add interfaces to a few of the deep learning models that I most commonly use in addition to copying in my Common Lisp client for Open AI's GTP-3 APIs

Work in progress - please come back here later
